About the software:

This is a free software that allows you to peak inside a USB in a second. When your 
	friend inserts their USB in your computer, you simply have to run this
	program. This will fetch all the directories and sub-directories in that USB
	and save their list on your computer so that you can have a have a look at 
	their USB content anytime you want. Also, the program is super fast, it will fetch 
	all the information in less than a second.

PS. This software doesnt fetch any files. It just fetches their names along with their
	paths, so that if next time if you get hold of their USB, you know what directory
	to go in first.
